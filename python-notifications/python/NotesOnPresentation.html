    <ul>
        <li>Make sure Powerpoint is easy to read in lighting, some templates are better than vanilla PowerPoint for this reason.</li>
        <br/>

        <li>Possible Templates </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ion Template</li>
                <li>Red Carpet</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>Dress similar color for team feeling, or atleast everyone dress professional.</li>
        <br/>

        <li>Practice with detail; have diagrams and or demos to talk through process of user (recording of features for people to see while talking though details)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In Powerpoint: Click Insert, then click on videos on the top left of menu to add video from computer.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>

        <li>Make sure everyone talks, don't have fish eyes and be sure to have small smiles instead of deadpan expressions while teammates are talking.</li>
        <br/>

        <li>Talk about the code (process, relation, and features), do focus on the code-side and the user interaction side.</li>
        <br/>

        <li>It <strong>may be a good idea to practice in the CEB Classroom </strong>ahead of time to make sure configurations are working the way we want it for presentation.</li>

        <br/>

        <li>Show database connections, on how the database connects with its tables.</li>
        <br/>

        <li>Try to minimize the number of times you say "um", small pauses seem better than hearing "um" constantly.</li>
    </ul>
